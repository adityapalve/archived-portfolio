## Designing Around Food 

This post talk about my first attempt at using the design systems
process and my learnings from it. 

## First Impressions

The first thought that comes to my mind on hearing problem solving is problem. The
first step is to identify a problem and then to think of sustainable, economical and
futuristic solutions to it. It is a process which requires critical thinking and is a skill
which can be used in our daily lives.

When your problems are simple then so are the answers but gradually as the
complexity and scale of the problems increase the solutions are not so apparent and
intuitive and thus problem solving becomes a skill which needs to be honed. In the
current world, problem solving skills are of utmost importance because the world
right now is very chaotic and unorganized. To improve the situation we have to be able
to come up with innovative ideas and hence develop the skill to identify and solve
problems. Whether it be the ecological clock that is ticking or the global problem of
poverty they are all very urgent matters.

The current situation of a global pandemic which we find ourselves in and how the
whole world comes with new ways to bring normalcy back is the most accurate
example of problem solving skills.

## Explore Case Study

The design process comprises of 3 stages. The first is the explore phase, which I will
be elaborating in this post through the case study involving Andra from Repsol. This is
the phase in which the needs of the consumers are evaluated and explored. It is all
about observation and researching the problems faced in the daily lives of the people.

Andra is a user experience designer in Repsol. They were hired to basically undersee
the transformation of the company from being completely reliant on oil to more
renewable energy sources. An interesting insight provided by Andra here is that this
task has to be perceived like changing the tires of a running vehicle you can’t really
say that the company will stop all operations and then completely switch to renewable
energy. The way ahead is to make small changes which eventually have a significant
effect in the overall scheme of things. An important part of the explore process, which
she emphasises on is, understanding the problem through the lens of the stakeholder.
She recounts the time her team had gone and spent a night at petrol pumps to
understand the problems through the perspective of the stakeholder and then design
efficient and impactful solutions to the problem. Often teams come up with solutions
and products but don’t know how they will do in the market this is why the primary
research is essential. Another great example given by Andra is when she and her
teammates were working on a project concerning electric vehicles. Interestingly,
initially the people were not able to figure out how to switch on the cars and the
simple solution to that was to out a sticker pointing at the button. She tells us that her
job in the company is sort of to connect the future of the company, where its heading
with different technologies and stuff, to the current operational ability of the company
and their methodologies. She remembers a gig where she had gone to an oil refinery
with huge chambers and realized that the workers there wore big gloves and this very
tiny bit of information was priceless because it showed her that the user does not care
for a small very beautifully designed button but a big one which can be used. All of
these tiny examples really left me flabbergasted. These very minute details completely
change the users experience and thus is an essential part of our job as designers.

Andra brings a very interesting perspective to the whole of the design process she
tells us that the customer or the client does not look for the electrons or the electricity
invoice its concerned if the house is warm or not and so forth. Essentially advising us
to destructure the problems into jobs to be done. She tells us her teams process, they
try and ask themselves, which kinda people is the solution targeted for, how people
will be effected by solving the problem. They use the classic design processes such as
shadowing and ethnography, interviews and group interviews. Through her
experience in the industry she tells us how board or the company does not really care
for the research they want the finished but it is us who design the solution and the
research is for us.

This interview with Andra is highly illuminating and her numerous experiences clearly
show us the importance of the explore process.

## Synthesis & Insights Project

>                                 The only stupid idea is the one never expressed.
>                                                                                – Luciano Castro.

Synthesis and Insights is the 2nd part of the design and thinking process. It involves
consolidating and organizing all of the information assimilated in the Explore part. We
aim to have narrowed down to particular problem statements from the vast amount of
research we have accumulated through the explore phase. This is where we identify
the key users and create journey maps to understand the various stakeholders their
daily lives and habits. We intend to define and understand the stakeholders, the
problems they face, and then innovate efficient solutions to their problems and see to
it that their concerns are addressed.

In this post I will be using the case study of Luciano Castro and how he used the
synthesis and insights process to hone in to the particular problems the users or
stakeholders were facing. His task was to create a product which better utilized the
company’s hub communication software and improved the overall experience of the
user and their interaction with the technology.

Their team had a huge database to pin point the real problems faced by the people
i.e. their users. This was also supported by all the data gathered thorough the explore
phase. The immediate step taken by the team was to create user journey maps and
personalities. These involved various aspects like their approach to technology, use of
social media, preferred brands and their needs. This allows us to understand the daily
habits of the key stakeholders. All this was performed remotely through
videoconferencing. During this phase the team tried to transform more general
problem statements into very problems pertaining to the targeted category of users .
Very similar to what we had to do in our food project. They first identified the intent
areas and then honed in to the problem statements and jobs to be done.

At this point of the process the team had completed brainstorming sessions using
interviews and such with the users. This allowed the team to gain a clear and better
understanding of the lacunae in the current interaction of the user with the
technology. The development of user maps are particularly useful for this because
they depict the impact of solving a potential problem on the targeted users daily
habits and activities.

This case study was very insightful to me because it showed me how the team
approached the problem in a very systematic and methodical manner and were able
to distinctly understand the problems faced by the problems faced by the users
through their perspectives due to user feedback . I could also relate to the team very
closely because of their working conditions and how they had to completely interact
with the user and get their feedback remotely as in the case of my projects because of
the new normal. In the end this process allows the designer to pin point the exact
needs and problems of the client and then through the use of journey maps try and
gauge the impact of the innovation.

## Ideation, Prototyping & Testing

The ideation, prototyping and testing phase is the last part of the process which
involves using all the information, to come up with ideas of solutions and then start
creating tangible, real products and then test them in the real world with the specific
stakeholders.

Ideation is the process through which you generate ideas and solutions through
prototyping, brainstorming. Prototyping is the process of making scaled down
versions of the product to test it with the customers. And testing involves using the
best solution from the ideation and prototyping phase and then taking in feedback on
it and checking if it actually works in the real world and whether it brings values to the
customer and solves his problem. The case study I would be referring to is of the
same person this time though I would be glossing over how Luciano and his team
went through the ideation and prototyping phase.

Luciano and his team had to perform this part too completely through remote and
they decided that the quickest way would be by drawing the solutions by hand on
paper. They sketched their ideas of products on paper and then seeked feedback from
the user or the customer.

They had a time limit of 3 days for the first prototype. After lots of meetings with their
developer team they realized that creating the back end systems in sync with the in
use systems would be a problem which had to be tackled by the developers team
while the front end system could be dealt with quickly and so their team decided to do
so. Hence 3 days later the team presented a first version prototype which consisted of
imaginary data and tried and represent the user interface of the software they were
trying to create. After some time they had an up and running beta software which
they could test using real users and thus gain essential feedback from them. The team
tested the prototype after every new change with as many people as possible. It was a
constant loop of prototyping then testing and then reiterating. The testing included a
walkthrough of the workflow of the system and its behaviour. The team used a simple
questionnaire to gather important feedback from its stakeholders which had signed
up for the beta testing.

The feedback to their prototype was quite positive and encouraging. This team
reiterated through the process until they arrived at a product which catered to all the
needs and concerns of the stakeholders. I think the team were phenomenal in their
practice and used most of the methods I have learned in this unit. This journey of
Luciano and his team are quite similar to mine in the food project. We basically as a
team reiterated through the process and kept on refining the products which we
showed through concept capture sheets. The user feedback stands out the most and
allows one to take decisions on which ideas to use and which to shelf.

## Post-Interview

My views on design and systems thinking have completely changed initially I had no
idea what it meant. Through the means of this unit I have been introduced so many
amazing methods of assimilating and processing information. The concept of journey
maps and concept capture sheet was amazing. It so often happens that due to the bulk
of information you eventually miss out on certain aspects but this methodical
approach really helped me overcome those hurdles. The unit taught me to ask the
right questions, categorize the stakeholders and gave me tools to understand the
story of the targeted user. It also taught me the importance of user feedback and how
to utilize it. Often one feels they have a brilliant idea but forget to take into
consideration any user feedback, the needs and concerns of the customers and the
stakeholders are of utmost importance and many a times may differ from ours. As
was the case in our project also some of the concepts and ideas which I thought were
amazing had to be scrapped due to legitimate critical feedback. I have really enjoyed
this unit and am very glad that I could create something tangible and real that is
backed by research and user vetted.

# Designing for Tomorrow: FOOD

## EXPLORE

The topic we had been given for our DST project was food at first it was such a vague
and vast topic I just could not wrap my head around it. We as a team had been given
the MURAL to work together and record our progress. We started by sticking post-its
on the MURAL and basically filling it everything that came up in our head. The most
impactful topic or problem which came to my head on the thought of food was waste.
And soon I realized that I was not the only one, it was a fairly common and popular
topic in out team and so we decided to limit ourselves from diving into the ocean of
various ideas and concentrate on waste due to food. Due to Dons advice and our
realization that this in itself was very huge we thought of concentrating on food waste
locally and maybe nationally. It was quite an interesting thing to learn about the
various food habits that amounted such huge amounts of food waste.

Initially we were kind of wandering into the solutions of the problems, a rookie
mistake I must say which was resolved through the advice of Travis. He told us to just
enjoy the process of finding problems and rightly so because despite of deciding to
investigate food waste we hadn’t quite thought it thoroughly. There were quite many
aspects in food waste too such as household waste, industrial food waste, waste due
to packaging etc. So effectively we had obtained an intent statement of sorts. After
researching by all of us dividing the task we decided to investigate and prod further
into household waste and research more into it. This is also piqued my interest
because it would allow me to improve my food habits and help conserve the
environment. After this we started to identify the key stakeholders related to our intent
statements and start researching about them.

## SYNTHESIS AND INSIGHTS

This phase allows us to assimilate all of the research done in the previous phase and
also gather data and primary research about the daily activities of our stakeholders.
We now had to create their personalities and deeply study their food habits
throughout the day. This was done by the help of journey maps which allows us to
record the daily habits of the stakeholders. This is to identify the lacunae in their
habits and help us understand the problems faced by them, so as to form problem
statements. The stakeholders also have to be categorized on the basis of distinct
factors, we all divided the stakeholders researched them separately.

After making journey maps of the various stakeholders, we gathered information by
asking ourselves a question of “How might We”. This delivered great insight to us and
allowed me to streamline the flow of information. There wea so much information that
it would have been easily missed had it not approached methodically. After we all
gathered our HMW’s we tried and picked the top 5 out of them so as to narrow down
our scope and hone in. All the information was stakeholder specific and research
backed.

## IDEATION AND PROTOTYPING AND TESTING

Now came the time of brainstorming solutions. We sat free styled a little and also
employed various methods introduced to us during the lectures. The main goal was
basically to create as many ideas for solutions to the 5 problems as possible. No idea
was bad left in the mind every thought was jotted down on the post its. We then each
chose ideas which appealed to us and tried and came up with concept capture sheets.
The point of the sheet being to materialize the idea of the solutions in the form of a
product which would address the needs and the concerns of the stakeholders. This
basically allowed me to come up with tangibles and produce real things form our
ideas.

The next step was to gather feedback as much as we could get on the various concept
capture sheets. This again made me love the idea of the sheet because it allowed me
to gather feedback very easily I tried and contacted stakeholders and nevertheless
also showed them to my parents and friends. They provided me with invaluable
feedback which was often critical of certain aspects and positive in others. Through the
minute analysis of this critical feedback and going through this loop about 3 times, I
was able to fine tune my products very nicely. Not only fine tune but many of our
ideas were scrapped out because of the feedback we received form many people.
Such as the idea of adding a sort of extended webpage which helped monitor dietary
plans in the app of Bristol University received legitimate negative feedback and was
thus shelved. Since all of us had done this process and reiterated through the
feedback loops our products were quite tested. We then finally decided to choose the
best idea with the help of a classical design and thinking method called the decision
matrix. The decision matrix put to rest all the debates about the best product and told
us to pursue the one which gained the most points. We marked the products across a
range of zero to five in many fields

### FINAL OUTPUT

The final idea of the project materialized as  vinyl wrappings for dustbins with
illustrations on them. This idea particularly had lots of positive feedback because most
of the people forgot which colour bins were supposed to be used for what purpose. I
felt that the colourful illustrations on the bins not only grab the attention but apply a
peer pressure of not doing the wrong thing. And I think this is what many of the
people also felt.

So all in all I really enjoyed this journey and am really glad that we were able to create
something tangible out of our ideas, which was backed by authentic research in the
end.
